This is part of your second project for this class. Its purpose is to get you further in software engineering experience. You will work in a group of groups of 6 or 7. You will select your group, they are not assigned.

You will do two presentations for the Large Project. The first (this one) is the type of presentation that you will make for management or potentially investors. This is listed as Large Project Pitch in the assignment section. You should talk about the end project, what it will take to get it done, and what you expect to encounter. This should be PowerPoint-based and have UML and/or ER along with enough supporting information to make your case. Pretend that your project could get canceled if this presentation is not very good. This presentation will be 7 minutes. Immediately in advance of your presentation you DO NOT have time to go the google drive, drop box, or the like and retrieve your material. You should have your slides and support material on a USB stick. All members must participate in the presentation.

The second presentation is listed as Large Project in the assignment section. will be a more complete PowerPoint presentation along with a product demonstration. You should talk about the entire development life cycle and issues that were encountered. You must specify who did what, and everyone must participate. You will have 15 minutes. Immediately in advance of your presentation you DO NOT have time to go the google drive, drop box, or the like and retrieve your material.

The slides must be professional and start with a title page followed by a members page. Then you should explain what the project is, how it was developed, and anything that you feel is important. UML and/or ER diagrams are required. Leave time for questions and have a questions page.

Project Requirements:
Remote database
Use any stack, but WISA, Lamp, and MEAN are preferred.
Use JSon to communicate between client and server.
You can use a windows program or an andriod/iOS app as the client. (A web page must be AJAX enabled.)
You need a Web page as part of the project.

The product can be of your choice. Make sure that when you decide what to do that it is reasonable in the time that you have.

The user interface should be clean and professional. The project should be as professional as possible. The source and support files must be in github (You will add the link to the sign up sheet).

Deliverables:
Zipped PowerPoint to the webcourse -- must be submitted before presentation
Powerpoint presentation
UML and/or ER diagram documents
Software demo -- your github link in the google doc sheet must allow inspection of all source code.
Everything must be submitted in a single zip (only submit the PowerPoint slides to the webcourse)
